        <h2>Stick Welding</h2>
        <p>
          Stick welding offers a solution for welding critical joints, and for situations where small or exceptionally precise welds are required. It can be performed with a wide variety of metals, and, when done correctly, it produces a high-quality and high-purity weld compared with other joining processes, which is crucial in many applications. The price of TIG welding services is also usually quite affordable. However, costs will vary depending upon the materials being welded, and the scope of the project. Overall, it is one of the most efficient ways to join two metals.

          <h3>Safety First</h3>
          <p>
            Welding can be dangerous and it is important that you take the necessary steps to ensure you stay safe when you are welding. The following items will be a good starting point for safety equipment.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Insulated/Welding Gloves</li>
            <li>Helmet With Eye Protection</li>
            <li>Pants (No cuff)</li>
            <li>Respirator or Lung protection</li>
            <li>Ear Muff or Plugs</li>
            <li>Rubber Soled Shoes</li>
