# just_try_welding_cl_master

This is a simple website that gives basic information on the different processes of welding, basic safety information, and some information on how to get started as a hobby with a reccomendation for a beginner welder.  This project will continue to grow as I develop more skills.

CSS Requirement 1
    
    Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop
        
        I met this requirement by utilizing flexbox to change the layout from a single column on a mobile device, as it gets to Desktop size it switches the content to three columns.

CSS Requirement 2

    Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation. Note: CSS Animations are not included in the assigned Treehouse track, you will have to research this on your own

        I met this requirement by adding CSS animation to the JustTryWelding logo in the nav menu,  when you hover over the logo it enlarges slightly, and rotates as well.

JS Requirement 1

    Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least 1 input (example, ensure email is in the proper format), and then use that information on your page somehow (ex: display it back to the user, or change a setting on the page based on a section)

        I met this requirement by including a contact form that allows for user input, if the format of the email address is not entered correctly it will display an error message.
