# just_try_welding_cl_master

This is a simple website that gives basic information on the different processes of welding, basic safety information, and some information on how to get started as a hobby with a reccomendation for a beginner welder.  This project will continue to grow as I develop more skills.  This website is designed mobile first and has 3 media queries to offer a better user experience for a mobile, tablet, and desktop view.

This project has had a minimum of 5 commits to github

CSS Requirement 1
    
    Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop
        
        I met this requirement by utilizing flexbox to change the layout from a single column on a mobile device, as it gets to Desktop size it switches the content to three columns.

CSS Requirement 2

    Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation. Note: CSS Animations are not included in the assigned Treehouse track, you will have to research this on your own

        I met this requirement by adding CSS animation to the JustTryWelding logo in the nav menu,  when you hover over the logo it enlarges slightly, and rotates as well.

CSS Bonus Requirement

        A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the “hamburger” menu item

            This requirement was met by utilizing flexbox on my nav menu and making the items in the menu move based on media queries for different screen sizes.  There are seperate layouts for mobile (stacked) tablet (centered horizontally) and desktop (spread along full width)
                    
                    ***asthetically there are some things that I need to improve on but the basic function exists***

JS Requirement 1

    Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least 1 input (example, ensure email is in the proper format), and then use that information on your page somehow (ex: display it back to the user, or change a setting on the page based on a section)

        I met this requirement by including a contact form that allows for user input, if the format of the email address or phone number is not entered correctly it will display an error message.

            ***This is a work in progress I have decided to stop tinkering with this to ensure my last push is before the deadline, it works but I realize it is not pretty***


***TESTING

I have tested this in chrome and internet explorer, I have determined that there are some issues with ie that effect the asthetics, but I believe it is still functional.

Comments are added for clarity and some additional comments are made for a reference for me to know what I want to do when I revisit this project in a few weeks
